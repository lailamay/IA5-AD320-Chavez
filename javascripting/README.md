Please read the instructions carefully before beginning this assignment. 

For this assignment, you will be using a Node module called Javascripting to strengthen  some core javascript skills and learn how to navigate basic operations within Node.js and NPM. You will be submitting the code you write to solve the javascripting exercises via github. 

- Create a new github repo named IA5-AD320-<YourLastName>
- Download and install Node.js on your development machine.  
-- You can download Node.js from here. https://nodejs.org/en/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. - Select the "Current" version
-- (Windows only) During installation you will see a screen with a checkbox asking if you want to install additional tools. Check that box. The additional tools will be needed to prevent NPM from having problems building certain packages. If you have already installed and did not check the box, send me a message and I will tell you how to install those tools with NPM. 
-- (Windows only) Once Node.js is installed you should see two programs when you search for node. One is called Node.js Command Prompt the other is called Install Additional Tools for Node.js
- Once installation is complete:
-- Windows users -> Open Node.JS Command Prompt
-- Mac/Linux users -> Open Terminal
- In the terminal/command prompt, navigate to your work folder(Your choice, no more MAMP restrictions!) and clone the repo you created in the first step. 
- cd into your repo
- Enter npm install -g javascripting in your Terminal/Node.js Command Prompt
- After successful install, enter javascripting at the command prompt. 
- Select the first assignment - Introduction.
- Create a new Javascript file in your repo folder and follow the instructions from Javascripting. 
- When you have written the code in your javascript file:
-- Test run it with either javascripting run <filename.js> or node <filename.js>
- If you are happy with the test run results, verify your code with:
-- javascripting verify <filename.js>
-- If there are errors in your code that cause the tests to fail, correct them and repeat the verify step. 
-- If the tests pass, type javascripting again and choose the next lesson. Note, the blue javascripting UI menu should show the last lesson now labeled as [Completed]
- Repeat until you have finished all the lessons.

When finished submit a link to your github repo that contains a javascript file for each lesson completed. 

Each lesson is worth 1 point (19 total) and the final point is your repo name matching the requirement above (IA5-AD320-<YourLastName>)
Tip: If you get stuck on a lesson, go back to the javascripting menu and try another one. Complete the easy ones first so you can maximize your points and not run out of time because of the tricky lessons. 
Tip: If the instructions from javascripting have scrolled too far offscreen in your terminal, you can print them again by running javascripting print
